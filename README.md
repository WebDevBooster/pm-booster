\* In agile development teams, the focus is 
on the **product**, NOT on the project. 
Traditional project management (often associated with the waterfall method involving Gantt charts etc.) 
is NOT the same thing as ***product management***. 

Agile principles, agile teams and the **product** management approach are most suited for projects that involve ***digital products***. On the other hand, for projects that involve ***physical products***, the traditional, waterfall style **project** management is usually much better suited. 
There are very substantial differences between the two approaches 
and mixing them is *not recommended* because it typically results in poor outcome.

PM Booster as a tool is meant for managing the development of **digital products** i.e. for **product management**. The word *project* in the description above is merely used for individuals who aren't yet fully familiar with the differences between project management vs product management and might therefore miss *PM Booster* as a tool that's actually better suited for their management needs (managing the development of digital products).
